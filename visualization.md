# 3d Visualization
Using a homemade python tool and using three.js, I am exploring polynomial parameterizations of surfaces, splines and more. The python files are available 
at my github [splines]("https://github.com/emersonjleon/math"). Thanks to Gabriela Sofía León for letting us use her three.js room.

### Examples:
- [boxspline](/threejs/bspline6c.html)
- [cobra](/threejs/cobra.html)
- [waves](/threejs/redwaves.html)
- [spikes](/threejs/spikes.html)
