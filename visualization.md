### splines:
Using a homemade python tool and using three.js, I am exploring polynomial parameterizations of surfaces, splines and more. The python files are available 
at my github [splines]("https://github.com/emersonjleon/math"). Thanks to Gabriela Sofía León for letting us use her three.js room.

### Chip firing:
The simple dynamics of chipfiring allow to create very amazing patterns for large computational experiments. I thank to [Caroline Klivans]("https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/cklivans/chipfiring.html") for presenting these topics to me.
